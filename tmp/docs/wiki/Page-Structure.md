The page structure for skeletor is quite simple. It is predominantly controlled by system blocks.

## Regions
### Header

The top of the page. By default contains only the search form.

### Navigation Bar

A place for the main menu. By default contains only Main menu (Nice menu).

### Splash Image

The top of the content area, contains slideshows and banner images. By default, the following blocks are on the the associated pages:

 * Header image (node/1436)
 * View: Header Rotator (< front >)
 * Header One (product/one)
 * Header Two (product/two)

### Second Sidebar

Custom page blocks are used significantly here, and allow for unique page layouts by specifying pages where the blocks are visible. By default, the following blocks are on the the associated pages:

 * Certification (node/1437)
 * Main menu 2+ levels (all pages)
 * Management (all pages, admin users)
 * Navigation  (all pages, admin users)
 * Next 2 events (< front >)
 * Last 2 blog posts (none)
